== Domain Model

=== Document, DocumentTemplate, Binder & Paperclip

The following class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/e181888a[link="http://yuml.me/e181888a", width="600px"]

(The colours used in the diagram are - approximately - from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Object Modeling in Color]).

The central concept is, of course, `Document`.  ``Document``s have content that is either a Blob, Clob or is text
, these attributes being defined in the `DocumentAbstract` supertype (more on this shortly).  Alternatively, the
``Document``'s content can be stored externally, eg in a CMS or cloud storage service, in which case the ``Document``'s
own `externalUrl` attribute is used.  The `DocumentSort` determines how the content of the `Document` is physically
stored (along with the supporting `DocumentNature` and `DocumentStorage` enums).  Conceptually ``Document``s are immutable
(though if their content is moved to an external URL, the original entity would be update in that case).

Each `Document` also has a corresponding `DocumentType`, eg "Invoice" or perhaps a form id, eg "ABC123".

The `DocumentTemplate` is also a document (ie subclass of `DocumentAbstract`), however its content will have placeholders.  These placeholders are populated with respect to some sort of domain object acting as an input (like a "mail merge"),
to generate a resultant `Document`.  The `DocumentTemplate` also has a `DocumentType`, and so it is the `DocumentType`
that acts as the link between the `DocumentTemplate` with the ``Document``s created from those templates.  It is
possible for there to be multiple ``DocumentTemplate``s over time for a particular `DocumentType` (distinguished by
date), to allow for minor changes to a template over time.  The domain model deliberately does *not* keep track of
which particular `DocumentTemplate` was used to create a `Document`, just the type is used.

Each `DocumentTemplate` has an associated set of ``Applicability``s.  Each of these identifies a domain class that can
be used as an input the rendering of the `DocumentTemplate`, with a corresponding implementation of the `Binder` interface
being responsible for actually creating an input "data model" used to feed into the template.

Each `DocumentTemplate` also has a `RenderingStrategy`, meaning a mechanism to actually produce its content from the
template text (once its placeholders have been replaced by "data model" provided by the `Binder`).

Every `Document` is created from a `DocumentTemplate`, but rather than hold a reference to this original template, instead `Document` and `DocumentTemplate` are unified through the `DocumentType` entity.  The document type can be considered as a set of versioned ``DocumentTemplate``s (identified by date), along with all the ``Document``s that were created from (any of) those ``DocumentTemplate``s.

Once a `Document` has been created it is attached to one or more target domain object using `Paperclip`.  This requires
a custom subclass for the domain object in question; the polymorphic pattern ("table of two halves") is used for this linkage.


Based upon the implementation of `RenderingStrategy` and `Renderer`, each `DocumentTemplate` can support either previewing and/or rendering.  Previewing means to return a representation as a URL; the end-user can then navigate to this URL without any change in state to the application.  Rendering on the other hand means the creation and persisting of a `Document` from the `DocumentTemplate`.

The `createDocument()` mixin is contributed to all domain objects where there is a `DocumentTemplate`
available for the domain object's application tenancy path (`atPath`) that supports either previewing and/or rendering.  However, for rendering there must also be at least one domain objects to which the resultant `Document` can be attached; if
there are none available, then create/save will be suppressed.  The `Binder` is used to identify which domain objects
the resultant `Document` is attached to; there must be at least one such domain object available (ie that has its own
subclass of `Paperclip`).


=== RenderingStrategy & Renderer

The  `Renderer` interface has the following subtypes and (example) implementations:

image::http://yuml.me/b63e782f[link="http://yuml.me/b63e782f", width="800px"]

The owning `RenderingStrategy` for each `Renderer` identifies the nature of the inputs and outputs (bytes or characters) of each `RenderingStrategy`; the associated `Renderer` implementation must meet those constraints.  Note that a `Renderer`
may produce nature of the inputs vs outputs may vary: a character template might result in byte array output.



== How to use

=== Input

For each domain object that you want to use as the input data to a `DocumentTemplate`, you need to:

* implement `ApplicationTenancyService` +
+
To return the application tenancy path of the domain object in order that available ``DocumentTemplate``s can be located

* implement a `Binder` +
+
These have two similar responsibilities: to construct the "data model" from the input domain object, and to identify the
 object(s) to which the resultant `Document` is attached. +
+
[NOTE]
====
It could be that a ``Binder``'s two responsibilities are quite separate from each other.  However, in the vast majority
of cases the input domain object and the object to attach the resultant `Document` to will be same, hence the decision
to combine these responsibilities into a single interface.
====

The `ApplicationTenancyService` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyService {
    String atPathFor(final Object domainObject);
}
----

while `Binder` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Binder {
    Binding newBinding(
            final DocumentTemplate documentTemplate,        // <1>
            final Object domainObject,                      // <2>
            final String additionalTextIfAny);              // <3>
}
----
<1> the template to which this binder implementation applies, as per `DocumentTemplate#getAppliesTo()` and `Applicability#getBinderClassName()`
<2> the domain object acting as the context for the binding, from which both the input data model and the objects to attach to (see `Binding`, below) are inferred
<3> optional text (eg for an email cover note) that may also be available to create the input data model

and `Binding` is in turn:

[source,java]
----
public class Binding {
    ...
    private final Object dataModel;
    private final List<Object> attachTo;
    public Binding(
            final Object dataModel,          // <1>
            final List<Object> attachTo) {   // <2>
        this.dataModel = dataModel;
        this.attachTo = attachTo;
    }
}
----
<1> used as input to the `RenderingStrategy`.
<2> specifies where to attach the domain object



=== Renderers

For each rendering technology, an implementation of `Renderer` is required.  A number of such ``Rendererer``s have been
developed, using Freemarker, XDocReport or just capturing the content of arbitrary URLs (eg as exposed by an external reporting server such as SQL Server Reporting Services).



=== Paperclips (attach output)

For each domain object that you want to attach ``Document``s (that is, add ``Paperclip``s to), you need to

* implement a subclass of `Paperclip` for the domain object's type. +
+
This link acts as a type-safe tuple linking the domain object to the `Document`.

* implement the `PaperclipRepository.SubtypeProvider` SPI interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface SubtypeProvider {
    Class<? extends Paperclip> subtypeFor(Class<?> domainObject);
}
----
+
This tells the module which subclass of `Paperclip` to use to attach to the domain object to attach to.  The
`SubtypeProviderAbstract` adapter can be used to remove some boilerplate.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(identityType=IdentityType.DATASTORE)
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(objectType = "estatioAssets.PaperclipForInvoice")
@DomainObjectLayout( bookmarking = BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class PaperclipForInvoice extends Paperclip {                    // <1>

    @Column( allowsNull = "false", name = "invoiceId" )
    @Getter @Setter
    private Invoice invoice;

    @NotPersistent
    @Override
    public Object getAttachedTo() {                                     // <2>
        return getInvoice();
    }
    @Override
    protected void setAttachedTo(final Object object) {
        setInvoice((Invoice) object);
    }

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    public static class SubtypeProvider                                 // <3>
            extends PaperclipRepository.SubtypeProviderAbstract {
        public SubtypeProvider() {
            super(Invoice.class, PaperclipForInvoice.class);
        }
    }
}
----
<1> inherit from `Paperclip`
<2> implement hook methods
<3> SubtypeProvider SPI implementation


[NOTE]
====
To view the ``Paperclip``s once created there is also a `T_paperclips` mixin collection, discussed below.
====


=== Mixins

==== T_createDocumentAndRender, T_createDocumentAndScheduleRender

The document module is fully data-driven, in that the ability to be able to create a document for any given domain entity
is defined by the data held in `DocumentTemplate` (its `atPath`) and `Applicability` (the `domainClassName` and corresponding
`Binder` implementation).

The `T_createDocumentAndRender` and `T_createDocumentAndScheduleRender` mixin actions exposes this functionality for
any domain class, by simply subclassing.  The former renders in the foreground, while the latter creates a background
command so that the rendering can be performed asynchronously.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Invoice_createDocument extends T_createDocumentAndRender<Invoice> {
    public Invoice_createDocument(Invoice invoice) { super(invoice); }
}
----

Add similar mixins for all classes where there exists a `DocumentTemplate` and `Applicability` capable of consuming the
object as an input to the template.

[TIP]
====
If you want make this action available for all domain objects, simply use:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Object_createDocument extends T_createDocumentAndRender<Object> {
    public Object_createDocument(Object object) { super(object); }
}
----

If there is no `DocumentTemplate`/`Applicability`, then the action will be hidden in the UI.  The reason that the
module doesn't just provide this mixin out-of-the-box is (a) for consistency with other modules and (b) for
understandability/traceability ("not *too* much magic").
====


==== T_documents

The `T_documents` mixin collection returns the list of ``Paperclip``s that each attach a `Document` to the specified
domain object.

Since ``Paperclip``s can only be created for domain objects where a subclass of `Paperclip` has been defined (see
above), it's typical for this mixin to be defined as a nested static class of that `Paperclip` subclass.
For example:

[source,java]
----
...
public class PaperclipForInvoice extends Paperclip {
    ...
    @Mixin
    public static class _documents extends T_paperclips<Invoice> {
        public _documents(final Invoice invoice) {
            super(invoice);
        }
    }
}
----



=== Optional SPI Services

==== `BinderClassNameService`

The `BinderClassNameService`, if implemented, provides UI to allow the binder class name to be changed on an `Applicability`:

[source,java]
----
public interface BinderClassNameService {
    List<ClassNameViewModel> binderClassNames();
}
----

This can most conveniently be implemented using the `ClassNameServiceAbstract` convenience class, eg:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class BinderClassNameServiceForEstatio extends ClassNameServiceAbstract<Binder> implements
        BinderClassNameService {

    private static final String PACKAGE_PREFIX = "org.estatio";

    public BinderClassNameServiceForEstatio() {
        super(Binder.class, PACKAGE_PREFIX);
    }

    @Override
    public List<ClassNameViewModel> binderClassNames() {
        return this.classNames();
    }
}
----

==== `UrlDownloadService`

The `UrlDownloadService` is used to download any ``Document``s whose content is stored as an external URL, eg in an on-site CMS or on a cloud storage service.

A default implementation of this service is provided that simply uses Java's `HttpUrlConnection` to download the URL; in particular the URL must be accessible and require no user credentials/passwords.

The service can be optionally overridden if credentials are required.

The service is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface UrlDownloadService {
    public Blob downloadAsBlob(final Document document) { ... }
    public Clob downloadAsClob(final Document document) { ... }
}
----


==== `DocumentEmailSupportService`

The `DocumentEmailSupportService` ...

[source,java]
----
public interface DocumentEmailSupportService {
    DocumentType blankDocumentType();                   // <1>
    void inferHeaderFor(
        Document document,                              // <2>
        EmailHeader header);                            // <3>
}
----
<1> returns a `DocumentType` where the supplied content and subject model is returned unchanged
<2> the `Document` for which the email is to be created
<3> the `EmailHeader` to be populated, specifying the to:, cc: etc details.

where `EmailHeader` is:

[source,java]
----
public class EmailHeader {
    @Getter @Setter
    private String subject;
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> toSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> ccSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> bccSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter @Setter
    private EmailAddress from;
}
----
