Notes:

* the incoming invoice state chart is now instantiated via a lifecycle event on invoice (rather than, as previously, listening to the document moving to a 'processed' state)

* ditto bank account's verification state chart

* After bank account verified, respective subscribers update any incoming invoices approved but awaiting verification before moving to `PAID`state
